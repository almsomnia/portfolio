         My name is Riva Almero. I'm a front-end web developer based in Bandung,
         Indonesia. I'm passionate about crafting pixel-perfect, engaging
         interfaces that not only look great but also provide an exceptional
         user experience.

         allows me to continuously sharpen my skills, explore new tools and
         frameworks, and stay adaptable in the fast-moving world of web
         development.

         My freelance web development roots are in Wordpress, where I learned to
         build and ship websites independently for real clients. Working closely
         with different client needs taught me how to balance speed,
         flexibility, and quality. That experience continues to shape how I
         approach projects today.

      <p class="text-pretty mb-4 leading-relaxed">
         In my free time, I enjoy photography and music. Both keep me grounded,
         and both influence the way I see and build for the web.
